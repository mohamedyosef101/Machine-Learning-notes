# **Dealing with <span style="color: #fc4444">Missing</span> Values**

### 1. Drop columns with missing values
The simplest option is to drop columns with missing values.

Unless most values in the dropped columns are missing, the model loses access to a lot of (potentially useful!) information with this approach. As an extreme example, consider a dataset with 10,000 rows, where one important column is missing a single entry. This approach would drop the column entirely!

### 2. Fill it with some number
Imputation fills in the missing values with some number. For instance, we can fill in the mean value along each column.

The imputed value won't be exactly right in most cases, but it usually leads to more accurate models than you would get from dropping the column entirely.

### 3. Fill it based on other columns
```python
# Example from titanic
grouped_age_median = titanic_df.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex'])['Age'].transform('median')
titanic_df['Age'].fillna(grouped_age_median, inplace=True)
```

# Categorical Data

### 1. Drop the data
The easiest approach to dealing with categorical variables is to simply remove them from the dataset. This approach will only work well if the columns did not contain useful information.


### 2. Ordinary Encoding
Ordinal encoding assigns each unique value to a different integer.

### 3. <b>ONE-<span style="color: #fc4444;">HOT</span> ENCODING</b>
Transforms categorical features into binary vectors that capture the presence of each possible value. 

##### <b>How it works</b>:

Let's say you have a categorical feature like color which can take on 3 possible values: red, green, or blue.

*For example, if the color is red, it becomes:*

- <span style="color: #fc4444">Red</span>: 1
- <span style="color: #4CAF50">Green</span>: 0
- <span style="color: #00a1ff">Blue</span>: 0

The "one" in the binary vector represents the color being encoded. This encoding allows algorithms like neural networks and logistic regression to work with categorical data.
