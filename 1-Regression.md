<h2><b>What is <span style="color: #00a1ff;">Regression</span></b></h2>
It can predict a continuous variable on the basis of one or more other variables.

<h4>Regression can set to achieve two goals:</h4>

    <b style="letter-spacing: .3px">Meaurement fo the influence of one or more variables on other variable.</b>
        <ul>
        <li> What influences childern's ability to concentrate?</li>
        <li> Do parents' educational level and place of residence affect children's future educational attainment?</li>

## Linear Regression
A linear relationship between target and predictor variables for modeling and predicting continuous, numeric variables.

#### Simple Linear Regression
It models the relationship between the dependent and independent variables as a linear function. 

> This function is a line (y = mx + b).

*m is the slope*  
*b is the intercept*

#### Multiple Linear Regression
Used to model the relationship between a single dependent variable and more than one independent variable.

> This multi-linear function is y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bn*xn

*b0 is the intercept*  
*X is the independent variable*
